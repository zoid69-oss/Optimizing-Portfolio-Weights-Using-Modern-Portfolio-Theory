# Optimizing Portfolio Weights Using Modern Portfolio Theory  

This project presents a comprehensive approach to portfolio management, risk evaluation, and time series forecasting. Using Python and advanced analytical techniques, I created a tool capable of optimizing portfolio weights to achieve efficient risk-return trade-offs. The tool incorporates risk assessment measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and utilizes time series models to forecast portfolio returns.  

Built on the principles of modern portfolio theory, the project combines portfolio optimization with time series analysis to generate actionable insights for investment decision-making. By leveraging libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, it enables seamless data manipulation, robust modeling, and clear visualization.  

This work exemplifies my proficiency in quantitative finance, statistical data analysis, financial time series forecasting, and Python programming, showcasing my ability to address complex challenges in portfolio optimization and risk management.
